# tools-golang

tools-golang is a collection of Go packages intended to make it easier for
Go programs to work with [SPDXÂ®](https://spdx.org/) files.

This software is in an early state, and its API may change significantly.

## Recent news

2021-03-20: **v0.1.0**: initial pre-v1 release tagged, prior to making more
extensive API changes in some pending PRs.

## What it does

tools-golang currently works with files conformant to versions 2.1 and 2.2
of the SPDX specification, available at: https://spdx.org/specifications

tools-golang provides the following packages:

* *spdx* - in-memory data model for the sections of an SPDX document
* *tvloader* - tag-value file loader
* *tvsaver* - tag-value file saver
* *rdfloader* - RDF file loader
* *builder* - builds "empty" SPDX document (with hashes) for directory contents
* *idsearcher* - searches for [SPDX short-form IDs](https://spdx.org/ids/) and builds SPDX document
* *licensediff* - compares concluded licenses between files in two packages
* *reporter* - generates basic license count report from SPDX document
* *utils* - various utility functions that support the other tools-golang packages

Examples for how to use these packages can be found in the `examples/`
directory.

RDF support was added by @RishabhBhatnagar as part of his Google Summer of
Code 2020 project, and is in the process of being merged into the main
tools-golang code.

## What it doesn't do

tools-golang doesn't currently do any of the following:

* work with files under any version of the SPDX spec prior to v2.1
* convert between different versions of SPDX documents (e.g., from 2.1 to 2.2)
* enable applications to interact with SPDX files without needing to care
  (too much) about the particular SPDX file version

We are working towards adding functionality for all of these. Code contributions
are welcome!

## Requirements

tools-golang uses https://github.com/spdx/gordf to manage RDF input and output.

Other than that, tools-golang does not require anything outside the Go standard
library.
